# Project Name:
SOLVE WORLD HUNGER AND OBESITY

## Problem
Millions of people are still dying from malnutrition every year. Around the world, a lack of food is a debilitating, often fatal problem. Nearly one in nine people worldwide are chronically undernourished, and 3.1 million children die of malnutrition each year. Also some people are eating too much food and this can cause healt issues such as to break down food, the stomach produces hydrochloric acid. If you overeat, this acid may back up into the esophagus resulting in heartburn. Consuming too much food that is high in fat, like pizza and cheeseburgers, may make you more susceptible to heartburn. So we have to solve the world hunger and as well as obesity too.  

Note from teacher: problem is malnutrion and obesity. heartburn is an issue to, but focus more on obesity.

## Big Fat Idea
Resolving the global food crisis could cost as much as $30 billion a year and wealthier nations are doing little to help the developing world face the problem. Less than two generations ago, people were following patterns in China. They were eating dinner for rationed rice or wheat and vegetables with a little bit of soy sauce. Today, most meals include excessive and plentiful vegetable oils, some meat or fish, eggs, and rice or wheat. Instead of wasting all that food, we can only get on well with a little bit rice with soy sauce. But my solution here is if there could be organization identitfies places where people are eating too much food and gets that food from them gives them to people who are not eating enough food. It will helpful in both ways. This organization can help those people who are eating to much to eat less food. With this organization we can solve both issues. One of them is the obesity and the other one is world hunger.

How much food does china waste per year?: Estimates suggest that China generates 17-18 million tonnes of food waste each year â€“ enough to feed 30-50 million people.
How many days there are in a year?: 1 year= 365 days 

Note from teacher: Make this more focused. Concentrate on YOUR solution. Also check your grammar.

## First Agile Iteration
User inputs: number of people, the average consumed per day by those people, the number of days and the recomended calories per day.
Program returns: calories in excess or calories deficent for that group.
