# Project Name:
SOLVE WORLD HUNGER AND WASTING IT 

## Problem
Millions of people are still dying from malnutrition every year. Around the world, a lack of food is a debilitating, often fatal problem. Nearly one in nine people worldwide are chronically undernourished, and 3.1 million children die of malnutrition each year. Also some people are eating too much food and this can cause healt issues such as to break down food, the stomach produces hydrochloric acid. If you overeat, this acid may back up into the esophagus resulting in heartburn. Consuming too much food that is high in fat, like pizza and cheeseburgers, may make you more susceptible to heartburn. 

## Big Fat Idea
Resolving the global food crisis could cost as much as $30 billion a year and wealthier nations are doing little to help the developing world face the problem. Rather than giving money we can also solve this if can all unite to solve world hunger. So that no one has to die, if we can all help. How? If people can be very helpuf those who are homeless or starving to eat something. Or even if all the governments can help their countries, with giving the oppurtunity to work somewhere or open a place where homless or poor people can come to eat food in every country and if the people who are wealthy can volunteer to help those people willingly. We can solve this problem together so quickly.  

There is  also one more solution too. It is eating patterns in China. Less than two generations ago, dinner for most Chinese consisted of rationed rice or wheat and vegetables with a little bit of soy sauce. Today, most meals include excessive and plentiful vegetable oils, some meat or fish, eggs, and rice or wheat. Instead of wasting all that food, we can only get on well with a little bit rice with soy sauce. 

.Also if there could be organization identitfies places where people are eating too much and gets that food who are not eating enough. It will help in both ways. First one it can help those people who are eating to much to eat less food. This can solve the obesity problem and also takes away the residual food from them and gives to the people who are not eating too much. This can solve the world hunger. With this solution we can solve both issues. One is world hunger and the othe rone is obesity.  

How much food does china waste per year?: Estimates suggest that China generates 17-18 million tonnes of food waste each year â€“ enough to feed 30-50 million people.
How many days there are in a year?: 1 year= 365 days 

## First Agile Iteration
User inputs: number of people, the average consumed per day by those people, the number of days and the recomended calories per day.
Program returns: calories in excess or calories deficent for that group.
