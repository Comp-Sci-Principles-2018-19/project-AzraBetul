# Project Name:
UNITE AND SOLVE WORLD HUNGER

## Problem
Millions of people are still dying from malnutrition every year. Around the world, a lack of food is a debilitating, often fatal problem. Nearly one in nine people worldwide are chronically undernourished, and 3.1 million children die of malnutrition each year.

## Big Fat Idea
Resolving the global food crisis could cost as much as $30 billion a year and wealthier nations are doing little to help the developing world face the problem. As we can see it still not enough. We can solve this problem with giving money too but if can all unite to solve this problem it would be great for all of us. So that no one has to die, if we can all help. How? If people can be very helpuf those who are homeless or starving to eat something. We can solve this problem together. Or even if all the governments can help their countries, with giving the oppurtunity to work somewhere or open a place where homless or poor people can come to eat food and if the people who are wealthy can volunteer to help those people. We can solve this problem together so quickly.  
I think this can only change if we can consider the eating patterns in China. Less than two generations ago, dinner for most Chinese consisted of rationed rice or wheat and vegetables with a little bit of soy sauce. Today, most meals include excessive and plentiful vegetable oils, some meat or fish, eggs, and rice or wheat. Instead of wasting all that food, we can only get on well with a little bit rice with soy sauce. 

there could be organization identitfies places where people are eating too much and gets taht food who are not eating enough. 
help people eat less better for them and also obsite problem and also solves the world hunger 
Number of people in China: 1.386 billion people 
How much food does china waste per year?: Estimates suggest that China generates 17-18 million tonnes of food waste each year â€“ enough to feed 30-50 million people.
How many days there are in a year?: 1 year= 365 days 

## First Agile Iteration
User inputs: number of people, the average consumed per day by those people, the number of days and the recomended calories per day.
Program returns: calories in excess or calories deficent for that group.
